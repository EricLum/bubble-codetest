//Still hate my solution

// What do I have to do?
//Clearer and Cleaner names & naming scheme.

//Consider a cleaner way of less loop within loop structures by putting the data into intermediate structures.
// e.g. make an array of the students instead of using the same class data that was parsed.


//Scope -- Do we want to look at total groups of groups, individual groups, which is the optimal way of optimizing how these are written
//without deep loops.
